# quickLesson1
A quick lesson for simple source control and coding. The first few steps will be dealing with using the cmd line and git. These are two essential tools for modern code development! Afterwards we will be updaing this repo to add source code for simple logic and applications to teach the simple principles of logic

1) if you've installed WSL open the ubuntu terminal. Follow this article to get to grips with installing and opening WSL 
https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-on-wsl2-on-windows-10#1-overview

2) we neeed to access the C drive through WSL. This means mounting the C drive. If you know some cmd line it should be easy to do. we're going to change the directory and then list the contents, something like this to get to the c drive:
<br/>`$ cd /mnt/c`
<br/>then to list contents of the current folder
<br/>`$ ls`
<br/>and the contents of the c drive can be seen (I plan on using this location for cloning the repo)
<br/>see the below link for more info and help

3) clone this repo into the c drive now that we have navigated to the c drive folder using the cmd line within WSL. With cmds like the following
<br/>` $ git clone git@github.com:VincentHui/quickLesson1.git`
